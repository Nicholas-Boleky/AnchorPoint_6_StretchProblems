 ## Add Ints
 
 ### Instructions:
 Create a func called add where the method allows one to pass as many or as few Ints as desired and then adds them together and returns the result.
 
 Example: If I call add(3, 7), it prints out 10. Example: If I call add(3, 7, 2, 4), it prints out 16. Example: If I call add(3, 7, 2, 9, 12, 11), it prints out 44.
